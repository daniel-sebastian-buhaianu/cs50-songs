Q1: 
    If songs.db contains the top 100 songs of one listener from 2018, how would you characterize their audio aura?

A1:
    I would probably use the same formula as Spotify's, calculating the average energy, valence and
    danceability for that list of songs:

    SELECT audio_aura FROM (
        SELECT AVG(energy), AVG(valence), AVG(danceability) 
        AS audio_aura 
        FROM songs;
    );
    

 Q2:
    Hypothesize about why the way youâ€™ve calculated this aura 
    might not be very representative of the listener. 
    What better ways of calculating this aura would you propose?

A2:
    I would also take into account the listener's most favourite artist.
    So I would combine the audio_aura with their top artists and genre of songs.
